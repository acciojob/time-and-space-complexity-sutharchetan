	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p> A description of how much computer time is required to run an algorithm. In computer science, Time complexity is one of two commonly discussed kinds of computational complexity, the other being space complexity. Problems that can be solved in polynomial time (that is, problems where the time complexity can be expressed as a polynomial function of n) are considered efficient, while problems that grow in exponential time (problems where the time required grows exponentially with n) are said to be intractable, meaning they are impractical for computers to solve.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution.This means that when a function has an iteration that iterates over an input size of n, it is said to have a time complexity of order O(n).</p>
